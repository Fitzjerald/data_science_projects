# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I applied a variety of statistical techniques, data analysis methods, and machine learning models, primarily using **Python** and **R**. Each project represents a unique exploration into data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

The projects in this repository stem from a blend of inspirations:

**Coursework:** Some projects were developed as part of the data science and machine learning university courses I completed.\
**Personal Curiosity:** Other projects were born out of my own curiosity, where I explored various datasets and applied techniques beyond formal training.
Key areas covered include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Clustering)
- Data Visualization
  
These projects serve as a practical demonstration of my skills in the field, continually evolving as I deepen my knowledge and experiment with new techniques.
