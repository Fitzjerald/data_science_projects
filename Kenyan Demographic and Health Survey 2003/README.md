# Kenyan Children Health Data Visualization

This project focuses on visualizing relationships in a dataset derived from the 2003 Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey, which includes data on children aged 0 to 5 years. After cleaning the dataset by removing irrelevant columns, we visualized key health metrics like Z-scores for stunting (zstunt), comparing these by age, gender, and urban versus rural living conditions.

**Technologies used:**

**R** with libraries:
- tidyverse
- ggrepel
- foreign

**Summary:**
The visualizations helped identify trends in stunting among Kenyan children, showing that stunting is more prevalent among boys and children in rural areas.
